# WeatherCLI
WeaterCLI is a simple weather application that uses the [NowCast from met.no](https://api.met.no/weatherapi/nowcast/2.0/documentation). \
To use this you need to modify [.env.example](https://github.com/Lyxminxx/weatherCLI/blob/master/.env.example) and change the spot that says youremail to be your email. Then rename the file to .env\
At this point just source the venv and start the main.py file. Feel free to add your own cities in norway by adding it to [possistions.py](https://github.com/Lyxminxx/weatherCLI/blob/master/possistions.py)\
