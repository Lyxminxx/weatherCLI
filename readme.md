# WeatherCLI
WeaterCLI is a simple weather application that uses the [NowCast from met.no](https://api.met.no/weatherapi/nowcast/2.0/documentation). \
To use this you need to modify [.env.example](https://github.com/Lyxminxx/weatherCLI/blob/master/.env.example) and change the spot that says youremail to be your email. Then rename the file to .env\
At this point just run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the dependencies. Then run [main.py](https://github.com/Lyxminxx/weatherCLI/blob/master/main.py).\
Feel free to add your own cities in Norway, Sweden, Denmark or Finland  by adding it to [possistions.py](https://github.com/Lyxminxx/weatherCLI/blob/master/possistions.py)
